> A mini-server for the spam protection team with lowdb

Comments on the server implementation:

1. I decided to use a simple data base like lowdb because I thought using something like MongoDB would have been and overkill for the required task.

2. I used a single error handler for all the errors for the same reason, the tasks are simple and straight forward and I thought it was not strictly necessary in this case to make a separated controller to handle individual errors. I would improve this first in case was needed.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run start
